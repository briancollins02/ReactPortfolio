# React Portfolio

## Description
This repository holds the code for a React front-end profile and portfolio. It was created so that when employers view my portfolio, that I can showcase my web dev knowledge through my personal site. Understanding React is a process that has made me realize how modular and granular you can get with web apps. I cannot wait to update this profile as I learn more about the technology and make the most impressive app I can.
